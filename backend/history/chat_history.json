        "summary": "Wildlife conservation is the practice of protecting plant and animal species and their habitats. The goal of wildlife conservation is to ensure the survival of these species, and to educate people on living sustainably with other species. The human population has grown exponentially over the past 200 years, to more than eight billion humans as of November 2022. World Wildlife Fund, Conservation International, the Wildlife Conservation Society, the United Nations, and National Geographic itself work to support global animal and habitat conservation efforts. They work with the government to establish and protect public lands, like national parks and wildlife refuges. National Geographic Explorer Michele Raggio and his team aim to get students excited and engaged with the animals around them. The Nature Ambassadors project, managed by the non-profit SeedScience, worked with six schools in the Morogoro and Chalinze districts of Tanzania."
