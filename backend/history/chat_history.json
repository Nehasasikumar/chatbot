        "summary": "Wildlife conservation is the practice of protecting plant and animal species and their habitats. The goal of wildlife conservation is to ensure the survival of these species, and to educate people on living sustainably with other species. The human population has grown exponentially over the past 200 years, to more than eight billion humans as of November 2022. World Wildlife Fund, Conservation International, the Wildlife Conservation Society, the United Nations, and National Geographic itself work to support global animal and habitat conservation efforts. They work with the government to establish and protect public lands, like national parks and wildlife refuges. National Geographic Explorer Michele Raggio and his team aim to get students excited and engaged with the animals around them. The Nature Ambassadors project, managed by the non-profit SeedScience, worked with six schools in the Morogoro and Chalinze districts of Tanzania."

        "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has a tremendous impact on how we do things and also the ways we relate to one another. New principles of AI bioethics must be considered and developed to provide guidelines for the AI technology to observe. The term AI is used to describe these functions of human-made tool that emulates the \u201ccognitive\u201d abilities of the natural intelligence of human minds. Along with the rapid development of cybernetic technology in recent years, AI has been seen almost in all our life circles. weak AI is designed to perform a narrow task, such as facial recognition or Internet Siri search or self-driving car. Some think weak AI could be dangerous because it could cause disruptions in the electric grid or may damage nuclear power plants when malfunctioned. The new development of the long-term goal of many researchers is to create strong AI or artificial general intelligence (AGI)"
